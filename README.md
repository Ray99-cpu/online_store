# Introduction
**Project Global Store** is based on the data experimental methodology, where I will be carrying out analysis, identifying trends, and showing visualisations that reflect what is within the data. The scope of this project will focus on the business requirements, hypothesis testing, project plan, and the analysis techniques used.


## Dataset Content
* Describe your dataset. Choose a dataset of reasonable size to avoid exceeding the repository's maximum size of 100Gb.
The dataset was obtained from the Kaggle website [Explore the E-Commerce Transactions Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/smayanj/e-commerce-transactions-dataset). It consists of 50,000 rows and 8 columns, but will be reduced to 10,000 rows and then have 11 columns after the feature engineering process. The dataset has been reduced in size to minimize the impact on the computer's resources. There will be further modifications to the dataset due to the insights to be generated by adding additional columns for year, month, and day. Also, the dataset will be balanced in order to gain insights into fraud that the business experiences.


## Introduction to the business
The business trades worldwide online, selling goods ranging from clothing, electronics and books. The business accepts a variety of payment methods, and purchase amounts range from £3.76 to £752.82. The business generates a fairly even amount of sales revenue from various countries, which may reflect that overseas markets for its products are quite competitive.

The business is likely to use the 5Ps to determine its marketing strategy. These are:
- Product – description of the product
- Price – pricing strategy to be used, which will range from price skimming to market-led pricing. This will aid customer segmentation based on the amount spent as one factor.
- Place  - Where the item will be available from, this will be direct from the store.
- People – The skilled staff within the business providing customer service.
- Promotion – The business is likely to use email marketing campaigns to sell products, inform customers about sales and promotions. Also, to generate data about the number of visits to the online store website, clicks, and the success of marketing campaigns.
Targeting different countries at different times of the year will be key to generating more sales revenue and provides an insight into the business's strategy. The table below provides an insight into celebrations worldwide for January.

## Business Requirements
* Describe your business requirements
•	To see which products sell the most at different times of the year in different geographic regions.


**Objective:** To identify the peak periods when different products sell in different geographic regions.

**Value:** This aids cash flow so the business does not purchase more than it needs.


•	To identify the different market segments and focus marketing on them to improve sales and customer satisfaction.

**Objective:** To identify and understand the different market segments and their purchasing habits.


**Value:** Marketing campaigns, from research to promotion, can be tailored to different segments to stay up-to-date with changing tastes and preferences. This will help to maximise sales revenue.


•	Detect fraud to reduce the loss to the business and to improve customer trust.


**Objective:** The cost of online e-commerce fraud is over  £35 million, and a business needs to reduce this loss.


**Value:** The business can reduce its revenue losses by flagging up transactions that are not ‘ordinary’ by tightening and improving its payment acceptance procedures.  This will benefit the business's cash flow.



## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* List here your project hypothesis(es) and how you envision validating it (them) 
Chi-square test and Welch's t-test have been used for hypothesis testing.
1.	Is the total purchase amount higher between March and August compared to November in the USA?

2.	Does the business prefer Credit Card payments over Cash on Delivery (COD)?

3.	The Sports category generates more sales than the Home & Kitchen category.


## Project Plan
* Outline the high-level steps taken for the analysis.
The objective of the project was to understand how the business is performing across the world. To know where and when the business generates the most sales revenue and to suggest ways in which it can improve is one of the drivers for this project. Another aspect is the extent of fraud that this business is experiencing, and suggestions can be made to the owners to safeguard against this.
The Gantt chart shows the various stages of the project, given the time frame.
